Introduction
============

What is distro.?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
distro. is a project by two Ngee Ann Polytechnic students, Joel Tio and Sean Nicholas, regarding the donation of computational power.

What do we do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We make the donation of computational power to science more covenient unlike the current `Beverly Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) <https://boinc.berkeley.edu/>`_ clients.

Why do we do it?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We made this project because people aren't really willing to download the BOINC client.

We run jobs using JavaScript after fetching them from a BOINC server.
