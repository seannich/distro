Introduction
============

What is distro?
---------------
distro is a programming project by two Ngee Ann Polytechnic students, Joel Tio and Sean Nicholas regarding the donation of computational power.

What do we do?
--------------
We make donating computational power to science more convenient unlike the current `Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) <https://boinc.berkeley.edu/>`_ clients.

Why do we do it?
----------------
We did this project because people aren't really willing to download the BOINC client.

How do we do it?
----------------
We run the jobs using JavaScript after fetching them from a BOINC server.

Example code 1: ::

	print('something')
	>> something

Example code 2: ::
	
	x = 1
	print(x)
	>> 1
